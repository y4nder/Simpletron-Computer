## 1. Module Overview

This module, `ProcessorFactory`, provides a factory method for creating instances of the `Processor` class (located in `ProcessorFiles.Processor`).  It currently offers a single factory method for creating a default `Processor` object.  The module relies on the `Processor` class for the actual processing logic.


## 2. Class: `ProcessorFactory`

The `ProcessorFactory` class acts as a factory for creating `Processor` objects. This pattern promotes loose coupling and allows for easier extension in the future to support different types of processors.


### 2.1. Method: `Processor_DEFAULT()`

```python
def Processor_DEFAULT() -> Processor:
    """ Creates a Processor instance
    Returns:
        Processor: 
    """
    return Processor()
```

This method is the core functionality of the `ProcessorFactory` class.  It creates and returns a new instance of the `Processor` class.  The algorithm is straightforward:

1. **Instantiation:** It directly calls the constructor (`__init__`) of the `Processor` class.  No specific parameters are passed, implying that the `Processor` class uses default values for its initialization.

2. **Return Value:** The newly created `Processor` object is returned.

The simplicity of this method allows for easy use and understanding.  The lack of any complex logic within this method makes it robust and unlikely to contain errors.  Future enhancements might include adding parameters to allow for the creation of `Processor` instances with customized configurations.  For example, one might introduce a `Processor_CUSTOM(param1, param2)` method to create a `Processor` with specific settings determined by `param1` and `param2`.  However, the current implementation provides a basic and functional factory method.

| Parameter | Type | Description |

|  (None) |  |  This method takes no parameters. |


| Return Value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Processor` object | `Processor` | A newly created instance of the `Processor` class. |
