# Simpletron Computer using Python üêçüíª

### Author ü§µ: Leander Lorenz Lubguban

The Simpletron Computer is a simulated machine designed to execute basic machine-level instructions, similar to early computers. It operates with a custom instruction set and uses memory to store both data and instructions. The Simpletron reads and processes operations like addition, subtraction, input/output, and control flow (e.g., jumps and halts) based on predefined operation codes.

## Example Usage (Operation Code Syntax)

1. create a file in the folder `codes` and name it `<your_program_name>`, save it as `.sml`

    ```sml
    0000    1014    ;get input and store to address 14 (variable n)
    0001    2201    ;Store to accumulator value 1
    0002    2115    ;Store to address 15 value of accumulator (variable factorial)
    0003    2014    ;Store to accumulator value of N
    0004    4212    ;Jump to address 12 if accumulator is 0
    0005    2015    ;Load to accumulator value of variable factorial
    0006    3414    ;Multiply accumulator value by variable n
    0007    2115    ;Store value of accumulator to variable factorial
    0008    2014    ;Load to accumulator value of variable n
    0009    3601    ;Subtract value of accumulator by 1
    0010    2114    ;Store to variable N value of accumulator
    0011    4004    ;Jump to address 04
    0012    1115    ;Write to the screen variable factorial
    0013    4300    ;Halt
    0014    0000    ;variable n
    0015    0000    ;variable factorial
    ```

2. run in terminal
    ```bash
    py Simpletron.py <your_program_name>.sml
    ```

### Example Usage (Mnemonics Syntax)

1. create a file in the folder `codes` and name it `<your_program_name>`, save it as `.sml`

    ```sml
    00  read    08    ; get input and store to address 08 (Variable A)
    01  read    09    ; get input and store to address 09 (Variable B)
    02  load    08    ; load address 08 into accumulator (Variable A)
    03  add     09    ; add address 09 (Variable B) to accumulator
    04  store   10    ; store the value in accumulator to address 10 (Result C)
    05  write   10    ; write the value from address 10 (Result C) to the screen
    06  writeA  00    ; write the value in the accumulator to the screen
    07  halt    00    ; Halt the program
    08  data    00    ; Variable A
    09  data    00    ; Variable B
    10  data    00    ; Result C
    ```

2. run in terminal with argument `-mp`
    ```bash
    py Simpletron.py <program_name>.sml -mp
    ```

#### Optional Debugger

running the program with debugger lets you view how the file is parsed and how the memory and accumulators are updated.

```bash
py Simpletron.py <program_name>.sml -debug
```

# Controller Component

### Summary

The `Controller` class orchestrates the interaction between a `Processor` and `IMemory` to execute instructions. It fetches, decodes, and executes instructions in a loop using provided operation codes.

#### Dependencies

<li>IMemory</li>
<li>Processor</li>
<li>OperationLibrary</li>

## Example Usage

```python
from Controller import Controller
from MemoryFiles.MemoryFactory import MemoryFactory
from MemoryFiles.MemoryLoader import MemoryLoader
from ProcessorFiles.Processor import Processor
from TextProcessors.ParserFactory import ParserFactory
from Operations.OperationLibrary import OperationLibrary

#create instance of processor and memory
processor = Processor()
memory = MemoryFactory.MemorySingleList()

#load memory with sml program
file = "testCodes/Factorial.sml"
parser = ParserFactory.LowLevelParser()
memoryLoader = MemoryLoader(memory, parser)
memoryLoader.load(file)

#define the library
library = OperationLibrary.OPERATION_CODES_DEFAULT

#create controller instace and inject the processor, memory and library
controller = Controller(processor, memory, library)

print("-" * 10)
print("executing file")

#run the program
controller.run()
```

## Methods

-   **`__init__`**: Initializes the Controller with Processor, IMemory, and operation codes.
-   **`getProcessor`**: Returns the Processor instance.
-   **`getMemory`**: Returns the IMemory instance.
-   **`run`**: Main loop to fetch, decode, and execute instructions.
-   **`__fetch_instruction`**: Fetches the next instruction from memory.
-   **`__decodeInstructions`**: Decodes the fetched instruction into operation code and address.

## Fields

-   **`__processor`**: Holds the Processor instance.
-   **`__memory`**: Holds the IMemory instance.
-   **`__operationCodes`**: Dictionary mapping operation codes to their corresponding functions.

data = memory.read_data(10)
print(data)  # Expected output: "1234" if the address is valid and data is stored, otherwise "Address not found"

# Dump memory state
memory.dump()  # Expected output: Visual representation of the memory state
```

# MemoryLoader

The `MemoryLoader` class is responsible for loading instructions from a file into memory. It uses a parser to read and parse the instructions and then stores them in memory.

## Example Usage

```python
from MemoryFiles.MemoryLoader import MemoryLoader
from MemoryFiles.IMemory import IMemory
from TextProcessors.IParser import IParser

class Memory(IMemory):
    def store_data(self, address: int, data: str) -> bool:
        # Implementation here
        return True

    def read_data(self, address: int) -> str:
        # Implementation here
        return "data"

    def dump(self) -> bool:
        # Implementation here
        return True

class Parser(IParser):
    def parse(self, fileAddress: str) -> list[Instruction]:
        # Implementation here
        return [Instruction(0, "data")]

memory = Memory()
parser = Parser()
loader = MemoryLoader(memory, parser)
loader.load("path/to/file")
```
